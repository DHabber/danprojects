Interference from the storms cut off all comms with the planet, and no one has come up the elevator to your station since. Concerned, the head of security has tapped you all to suit up and find out what's going on. You've transited a few times before - your families live down the 'lift - but this time is different: something terrible caused those storms, and you're heading right into the thick of it...!"
